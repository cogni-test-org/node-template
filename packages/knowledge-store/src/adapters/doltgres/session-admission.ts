/**
 * Module: `@cogni/knowledge-store/adapters/doltgres/session-admission`
 * Purpose: Admission control for Dolt branch work — bound concurrency ABOVE the connection pool so a burst of writers queues instead of starving the pool.
 * Scope: FIFO queue, cross-replica advisory lock, bounded reserve, and client recreation for session-pinned operations. Does not gate ordinary pooled reads — a write-side proof must never decide whether a read is served (bug.5358).
 * Invariants:
 *   - DOLT_SESSION_ADMISSION: admit one operation BEFORE reserving, never after.
 *     Reserving first is what wedges the pool; see `DoltBranchSessionRunner`.
 *   - `KNOWLEDGE_BRANCH_LOCK_KEY` must differ from every other advisory-lock key
 *     used against the same Doltgres database — `@cogni/work-items` owns
 *     `5_001_001` and shares `DOLTGRES_URL` with this package.
 *   - The runner owns the only `sql.reserve()` call in this package.
 * Side-effects: IO (database connections), time (deadlines + lock retry backoff)
 * Links: docs/spec/knowledge-syntropy.md, packages/knowledge-store/AGENTS.md

/**
 * Serializes Dolt branch operations and hands each one a proven session.
 *
 * WHY ADMISSION CONTROL AND NOT A BIGGER POOL (bug.5391, mirroring the proven
 * `@cogni/work-items` shape):
 *
 * Every Dolt branch operation needs a session-pinned connection, because
 * `dolt_checkout` is session state. postgres.js exposes that as `reserve()`,
 * and a reserved connection is pinned for the WHOLE operation — on Doltgres
 * that is several seconds of `dolt_merge`/`dolt_commit`/`dolt_branch` under
 * load (bug.5395 measured a lease p99 of 4330ms).
 *
 * Two failure modes compound on the shared `max: 5` pool that also serves
 * reads:
 *
 *   - Starvation. Concurrent branch ops hold their reserved connections for
 *     seconds. Once every slot is held, the next caller's query is parked on
 *     postgres.js's UNBOUNDED `queries` backlog with no deadline of its own —
 *     so reads hang right alongside the writes. That is the prod signature:
 *     four `knowledge.contributions.close` calls timing out in the same second
 *     while the list route intermittently stopped answering (bug.5391).
 *   - A cold `reserve()` that never settles. On a `fetch_types: false` client —
 *     mandatory for Doltgres — `ReadyForQuery` skips `fetchArrayTypes()`, so
 *     `onopen` never fires, and `onopen` is the only caller of
 *     `query.reserve(c)`. `connect_timeout` was already cancelled, so nothing
 *     rescues it and the slot is gone for the process lifetime (bug.5386).
 *
 * Priming with a plain query before reserving fixes the second mode. It does
 * nothing for the first, which is why PR #2611 converted an infinite hang into
 * a bounded 15s error without stopping the outage.
 *
 * Raising `max` only defers the wedge and multiplies reserved sessions on a
 * latency-prone substrate. The fix is to bound concurrency ABOVE the pool:
 *
 *   1. FIFO queue — admit ONE operation before it reserves, so a burst queues
 *      instead of racing. Bounded by `queueWaitMs` so a caller fails fast.
 *   2. Prime, then reserve, under ONE deadline covering both. The deadline must
 *      span the prime: on an already-exhausted pool the priming query is itself
 *      parked on the unbounded backlog, so bounding only the reserve still
 *      hangs. Missing the deadline means the pool is wedged: terminate the
 *      client and rebuild it, rather than hand the next caller a pool with one
 *      fewer slot.
 *   3. `pg_try_advisory_lock` — the same one-at-a-time guarantee across
 *      replicas, which an in-process queue cannot give.
 *
 * The pool behind this runner is then deliberately `max: 1`, and it is NOT the
 * pool that serves reads.
