// Self-tests for check-node-ci-workflow.mjs.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the checker's whole purpose is to prove that every context
// named in .cogni/repo-policy.json is actually emitted, on review events, by exactly
// one job that cannot skip. A checker that silently stops catching drift is worse than
// no checker — it reports "protected" while a spawned node's required check never
// reports and its default branch deadlocks. A green run against the current tree
// proves nothing about that; only a mutation that MUST fail does.
//
// Each case mutates a throwaway copy of the real workflow/policy files and asserts the
// checker exits non-zero with a recognisable message.
